TruthGuard AI - Fake News Detection

Project Overview:
TruthGuard AI is a machine learning project focused on detecting fake news using advanced neural network techniques. The model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify news articles based on their credibility, achieving an impressive accuracy of 93%. The project aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying misinformation and enhancing information reliability in the digital age.

Key Features:
LSTM Model: Utilizes LSTM networks to effectively analyze sequential data and detect patterns indicative of fake news.
Data Sourcing: Data was collected from Twitter using Kaggle datasets, encompassing a wide range of news articles and social media posts.
Deployment: The model has been successfully deployed, making it accessible for real-time fake news detection.

Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language for data processing and model training.
Keras: High-level neural networks API to build and train the LSTM model.
TensorFlow: Backend for training the neural network.
Flask: Framework used for deploying the web application.
Kaggle: Source of the Twitter data used for training and testing the model.

Data Sources:
Twitter Data: Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset contains various tweets and articles labeled as real or fake.
